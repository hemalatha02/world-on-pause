<p>The first case of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kerala (which was also the first in all of India) was confirmed in Thrissur on 30 January 2020. The number of active cases initially peaked at 266 on 6 April before declining. For the first time in over 45 days, there were no new cases on 1 May.[4] However, following the return of Keralites from other countries and states, more cases were reported in mid-May, with the biggest single-day spike (1078 cases) on 23 July. As of 24 July, there have been 16,995 confirmed cases with 7,564 (42.31%) recoveries and 54 deaths in the state.[5] Kerala has one of the lowest mortality rate in India (0.3%) compared to the national average of 2.41%. Kerala's success in containing COVID-19 has been widely praised both nationally and internationally.

Travellers will have to fill in self-report forms and submit at the help desk. 15 to 20 people will be deboarded at a time, with one-metre distance between them. At the aerobridge, their temperatures will be checked. Those running a fever will be sent to the isolation bay. If they do not have a fever, they will be directed to the help desks. Each of the help desks will be manned by a doctor, staff nurse, volunteer and a data entry operator. Passengers are checked for fever or other symptoms at the help desk by the doctor.

<h3>Post-arrival protocols</h3>
<h2><a href="https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/coronvavirushelplinenumber.pdf">HELPLINE</a></h2>
<p>Separate mobile health applications have been created to register and track the expatriates who will arrive at three of the airports in the first phase – Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode. The app to be used at Thiruvananthapuram is named 'Karuthal' (precaution in english), the one designed for Kochi is Ayurraksha and the one for Kozhikode is Agamanam (arrival in Malayalam). All the details of those who have registered on the NORKA website have been plugged into the app. Using QR codes, each of the travelers can be contacted and traced.</p>

<p>Initially, there will be a basic medical screening for those wishing to return home. Only those found asymptomatic will be allowed to board the aircraft. Medical teams will be deployed at the arrival lounge with screening facilities. The passengers will be home quarantined for 14 days and monitored by ward-level Vigil Committees in their residences. Those who wanted to stay in corona care homes will be shifted to such centres near airports. The state government has requested the Centre Government to provide passengers' list before their arrival in Kerala Airports. The expatriates has to strictly undergo the mandatory quarantine time period in government-arranged facilities of seven days. On the seventh day, PCR test for coronavirus will be conducted and those who tested negative will be sent home. The test result will be announced the next day. Those who test positive will be sent to hospitals. Those who proceed to their homes will have to remain in quarantine for one more week. Antibody tests would also be widely done on overseas returnees.</p>
