The first case of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu was reported on 7 March 2020. Tamil Nadu has the second highest number of confirmed cases in India after Maharashtra. All 37 districts[note 1] of the state are affected by the pandemic, with capital district Chennai being the worst affected. More than half of the confirmed cases are from Chennai, which is also the most populous district of the state. The case fatality rate in the state is among the lowest in the country.</p>

<p>As per the Health Department, 88% of the patients are asymptomatic while 84% of deaths were among those with co-morbidities.[1][2] In June, the state saw a surge in deaths with 209 deaths (36% of the state's recorded deaths) occurring between 11 and 16 June.[3] The initial surge in cases in the state was due to a cluster linked to a Tablighi Jamaat religious congregation event that took place in Delhi, which caused a spike in early April. Another large local cluster in Koyambedu of Chennai was identified in May.[4] In early June, forecasts based on mathematical models by epidemiologists of the Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R. Medical University projected that Chennai may witness 150,000 infections and up to 1,600 deaths by mid-July at the current rate of growth.</p>

<p>The state government has responded to the outbreak by following a contact-tracing, testing and surveillance model.[5] The state has 85 laboratories approved by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), capable of conducting tests.The state has been under a lockdown since 25 March which was relaxed to an extent from 4 May onwards. The lockdown was further extended until 30 June with significant relaxations from 1 June. The state has enforced a stricter lockdown in four majorly-affected districts which includes Chennai and its three neighbouring districts of Chengalpattu,Thiruvallur and Kancheepuram from 19 to 30 June.</p>
